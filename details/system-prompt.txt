We have got JSON records that describe well-known novels, with fields "author", "title", and "year".
This information may be somewhat unreliable; for example, "year" is not necessarily the year when the novel was first published.
Sometimes the "author" field might contain the year of birth and the year of death of the author, or some other useful identifying information.
There may also be some entries that describe books that are not novels.
For each record we need to find this information:

- year = the correct year when the book was first published
- author_gender = the gender of the author
- author_year_of_birth = the author's year of birth
- genre = the genre of the book
- target_audience = the age of the target audience

Set "genre" = "not a novel" if the book is not a novel (e.g. a collection of short stories or poetry).
Leave those fields empty that cannot be reliably determined, or if they are ambiguous (e.g. multiple authors with mixed genders).
